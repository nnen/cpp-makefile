C++ Makefile
============

This is a simple Makefile for simple C++ projects. It is by no means meant to
be completely comprehensive or platform-independent.  I just make it work where
I need it to.

To download the current version to current directory, do:

    $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/nnen/cpp-makefile/master/Makefile
